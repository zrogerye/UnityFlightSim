Gaem V1: basic flight simulator, fly around nothing much

Gaem V2: flight simulator with more physics and LASERS, if you crash, then you break into pieces

Gaem V3: small tweaks, you can no longer shoot when you have crashed, click the reset button to reset the game, added UI for score and high score, but have not yet implemented the code, the UI is currently hardcoded, i have to learn how to not do that

Gaem V4: fixed UI so it isnt hardcoded
